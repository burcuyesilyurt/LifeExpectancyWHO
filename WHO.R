#Income composition of resources (ICR) seems like it's a composite variable in itself

#Interesting - since the schooling coefficient for developing is over 2x higher than that of developed,
#it appears that schooling has a stronger impact on life expectancy in developing countries. That is, on
#average, in developing countries, each additional year of school adds two years to one's life, while in
#developed countries, it adds about 0.9 years. In both cases, the varaible schooling is (very) significant.

#However, this may just result from the fact that schooling is strongly related to other variables (as found
#earlier). Now, let's control for other similar variables and see if schooling is still a significant predictor.
#Schooling was highly correlated with income composition of resources and alcohol. Controlling for those two,
#as well as status, let's see if schooling is still significant.

#Well, the right-skewedness of the data (as evidenced by the concave-up Q-Q plot) was worse than I thought,
#and not just limited to Antigua and Barbuda. Even so, the model is still useful, and tells us that schooling
#does have a significantly positive relationship with life expectancy.


#Q2: Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan? 
#We'll check to see if there's a significant difference in percentage of total expenditure between countries with a high life expectancy versus those with a low life expectancy.

#Because the resulting p-value is 0.1959 which is greater than our  ùõº=0.05 , we fail to reject the null hypothesis 
#and cannot conclude that countries with high life expectancy spend more of their money on healthcare than countries with low life expectancy.

#At a significance level of  0.05 , we see that both adult mortality and infant deaths have nonzero coefficients by looking at their p-values. 
#We also see that the coefficients  ùõΩÃÇ  are negative which means that when adult mortality or infant deaths is higher, life expectancy tends to be lower.
