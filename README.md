PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The primary objective of this research initiative is to discern and analyze the pivotal determinants that exert a substantial influence on life expectancy. The overarching aim is to systematically investigate the factors that a health organization can potentially modify to augment life expectancy within a specific geographic locale.[1] Through rigorous examination and statistical analysis, this study seeks to identify and prioritize the key variables that play a critical role in shaping life expectancy outcomes, thereby providing actionable insights for targeted interventions and healthcare strategies.
